# Solution

The C-Movie Platform is going to compite in a crowded bussiness space. For this is important before doing a big upfront investment validate if there is a bussiness value on the project. For this the solution should be solved in diferent phases.
- MVP: Simple passthrough to one of de platforms we are going to work with. This will allow to get traffic data and start building SEO Ranking.
- MLP: Implementation of the algorithm with a few real time APÃŽ sources. Keep the code modular and independant to be able to extract later into the data platform. Helps validate the value of our propietary algorithm.
- Release 1: Initialize a data platform, by consuming csv data. Consume this data from the systems.
- Release 2: migrate real time API and calculation algorithm to comply with the data platform structure.
